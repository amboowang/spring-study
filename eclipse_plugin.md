## What's target platform in PDE

> The target platform specifies the Eclipse configuration that you are developing your plugins for. This is defined by the set of available plugins and features. It defaults to mirroring the configuration of the Eclipse instance that you are running, but in most cases you will want to change it to something more specific. For instance, you may be running Eclipse 3.6, but developing plugins for Eclipse 3.5, or you may be developing a plugin on top of WTP, but you don't need WTP functionality in your development eclipse instance.
